# OSM-Project

A navigation system using Open Street Map data that helps users navigate buildings on Northwestern University's campus developed in C++.
This project processes xmldocs and creates WU Graphs. The document within the files is one that stores information on buildings at Northwestern. 
Ultimately, the program builds a graph of the Northwestern University campus from the nodes and footways and use Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to navigate between buildings.
